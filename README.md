  - Rebin the spectrum resolution: the code rebin the spectrum reducing the resolution power
  - Automatized instrumental error propagator: the code estimate the instrumental error propagating the analitycal expresion of the square of the sum of the derivatives
  - fancy plotter: some setup of make fancy plots
