# Sky subtraction from the some Star specra
In this repository you can find two files, one is a Python script code to substract the sky spectra (tellurics lines) to some star spectra, 
  and the other is a folder with some test made for the comparison of our method, which contains their respective python script, and the spectres what we use.
  
For the usage of the code, please modify the path which harbor the spectra files in the script.

To compile the test of our sky subtraction method, download the folder 'sky_test' and simply compile the script.
